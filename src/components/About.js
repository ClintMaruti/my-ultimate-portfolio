            Hi, I’m Clint Maruti, a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years
            of experience in building scalable, high-performance full-stack
            applications. I specialize in solving complex problems and
            delivering exceptional user experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I’ve worked on diverse projects, from
            AI-powered legal research platforms to dynamic chatbots that drive
            business revenue. I excel in collaborative environments, leveraging
            my expertise in both front-end and back-end development to create
            intuitive, business-driven solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m passionate about cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine
            learning, and cloud computing. Whether it’s designing resilient
            system architectures, optimizing backend performance, or creating
            user-friendly interfaces, I’m always eager to take on new challenges
            and deliver results that exceed expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring the latest trends in
            tech, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring aspiring
            developers. I believe in the power of continuous learning and
            innovation, and I’m always looking for ways to grow both personally
            and professionally.
          </p>
          <p>Let’s connect and build something amazing together!</p>
